# Intrusion Detection System for Smart Wheelchair Networks (IDS-4-SWC)

Official repo for the paper Enhancing Security in IoT-Based Smart Wheelchair Networks with an Intrusion Detection System.

The [Hacking and Countermeasure Research Lab - HCRL Dataset](https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets) was used to train and test the model. Specifically:
+ The [CAR HACKING: ATTACK & DEFENSE CHALLENGE 2020 DATASET](https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/carchallenge2020) and,
+ The [Car-Hacking Dataset for the intrusion detection](https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/car-hacking-dataset)
